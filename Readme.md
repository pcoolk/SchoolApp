## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows the classic **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern to ensure a clean separation of concerns.

* **Model:** Data objects (`Contact.java`, `Holiday.java`) that represent the application's data. Lombok is used to reduce boilerplate code (getters, setters, etc.).
* **View:** Thymeleaf templates (`.html` files) located in `src/main/resources/templates` that render the user interface.
* **Controller:** Classes in the `controller` package that handle incoming HTTP requests, process user input, interact with the service layer, and select a view to render.
* **Service:** The `service` layer contains the business logic. For example, `contactService` handles the processing of submitted contact forms.
